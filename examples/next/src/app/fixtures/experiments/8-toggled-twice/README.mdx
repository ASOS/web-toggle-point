# Toggling Toggles

## Explanation

This example demonstrates how different toggle types and conventions can compound.

The experimental variant is stored in a folder structure:

```
./__variants__/test-feature/test-variant/component.tsx
```

It has variants that are colocated in the same folder, with a postfix to their filename:

```
./__variants__/test-feature/test-variant/component.a-m.tsx
./__variants__/test-feature/test-variant/component.n-z.tsx
```

A bespoke toggle handler unpicks the character ranges from the variant filenames, and adds
each letter to the potential variations considered by the join point.

A bespoke reactive toggle point with coupled features store is set to listen for key presses, 
and modify the active feature to match any held alphabetic character, passing a `children`
render prop to the varied component that outputs the key pressed.

## Activation

If an `experiments` header is set, with a `"test-feature": { "bucket": "test-variant" }`
decision, the experimentally varied component will show.  If a key press of an alphabetic 
character is held, then this is itself varied, either a "variant 1" or "variant 2" (dependent
on character range), with the key pressed passed as a string child to the component.

# @asos/web-toggle-point-react-pointcuts

This package provides react application pointcut code, acting as a target toggle point injected by the [`TogglePointInjectionPlugin`](../../webpack/docs/README.md)

It contains the following exports from the base package (`@asos/web-toggle-point-react-pointcuts`):

- `withTogglePointFactory`

This is a factory function used to create a `withTogglePoint` [react higher-order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).

- `withToggledHookFactory`

This is a factory function used to create a [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)-wrapping function.

The product of both these factories receive the outcome of the webpack plugin, used to choose appropriate variants at runtime, based on decisions from a supplied context.

Both accept plugins, currently supporting a hook called during code activation (mounting of the  component, or calling the hook).

It also contains a package export:

- `@asos/web-toggle-point-react-pointcuts/lazyComponentLoadStrategyFactory`

This is a factory for a load strategy for use with the webpack [`TogglePointInjectionPlugin`](../../webpack/docs/README.md) for when lazy-loading / code splitting is desired.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In SSR scenarios, a streaming render should be used (i.e. [`renderToPipeableStream`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream) or [`renderToReadableStream`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream)) when using this load strategy, as is inherent with [`React.lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy), otherwise the following error will be produced:
>
> > Error: A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with `startTransition`.

## Usage

The package has a peer dependency requirement of [`react`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react) (with version-matched [`react-is`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-is)), and should work with React 17 and above.

See: [JSDoc output](https://asos.github.io/web-toggle-point/module-web-toggle-point-react-pointcuts.html)

> [!WARNING]
> ### Use with React 17
> The package should work with React 17 and above, but due to [a bug](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20235) that they are not back-filling, the use of `"type": "module"`
> in the package means webpack will be unable to resolve the extensionless import.
> To fix, either upgrade to React 18+ or add the following resolve configuration to the webpack config:
> ```js
> resolve: {
>   alias: {
>     "react/jsx-runtime": "react/jsx-runtime.js"
>   }
> }
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Since React 17 does not support suspense for code splitting during server-side rendering, where a `lazyComponentLoadStrategyFactory` strategy is used, this will preclude the use of Server-Side Rendering.  You will receive the following:
>
> > ReactDOMServer does not yet support Suspense.

> [!WARNING]
> ### Use with NextJS
> The package will work with NextJs (see caveats in [next example](../../../examples/next/README.md)), but since NextJs uses it's own "pre-compiled" versions of 
> `react` and `react-is`, the `Symbol` used to mark react types needs to be aligned, since this package uses `react-is` to detect if a toggled component is "lazy" or not.
> To ensure that the next-specific version of `react-is` is used by the application build, it can be aliased in the webpack config of the NextJs app thus:
> ```js
> resolve: {
>   alias: {
>     "react-is": `next/dist/compiled/react-is/cjs/react-is.${process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "production" : "development"}.js`
>   }
>}
> ```
> N.B. The compiled entrypoint for CJS doesn't re-export named exports properly, so you'll need to select the production or development build as appropriate, as shown.
